You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store. Each packet costs 1.49 dollar and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar. Find out using python, how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?

# Given information
total_packets = 9
cost_per_packet = 1.49
amount_given = 20.
# Calculate the total cost of the potato chips
total_cost = total_packets * cost_per_packet
# Calculate the amount the shopkeeper will give you back
change = amount_given - total_cost
# Print the result
print("The shopkeeper will give you back $", change)
The shopkeeper will give you back $ 7.61
