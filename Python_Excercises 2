You want to replace tiles in your bathroom which is exactly square and 5.5 feet is its length. If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, how much will be the total cost to replace all tiles. Calculate and print the cost using python (Hint: Use power operator ** to find area of a square)

# Given length of the square bathroom in feet
length_of_bathroom_in_feet = 5.5

# Given cost of tiles per square foot in rs
cost_per_square_foot = 500

# Calculate the area of the square bathroom in square feet
area_of_bathroom_in_square_feet = length_of_bathroom_in_feet ** 2

# Calculate the total cost to replace all tiles
total_cost = area_of_bathroom_in_square_feet * cost_per_square_foot

# Print the total cost
print("The total cost to replace all tiles is:", total_cost, "rs")
